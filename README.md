## Why

Visualization helps provides intuition and understanding. This project tries to answer the question

    What am I running on my environment?

## What

Docker GUI's main goal is to give a user friendly display of everything that is running in your Docker daemon and, in the future, provide powerful CRUD capabilities. 

## How

Docker GUI is a Node app built with React, ÂµWS, execa, Dockerode, and Express.
